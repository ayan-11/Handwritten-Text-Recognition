# Handwritten Text Recognizer

![Handwritten Text Recognizer](images/handwritten_text_recognizer.png)

## Overview

The Handwritten Text Recognizer is a deep learning project designed to recognize handwritten text from images. This project employs state-of-the-art deep neural networks to accurately transcribe text from handwritten notes, documents, or any other sources.

## Features

- **Handwriting Recognition:** Accurately transcribe handwritten text into digital form.
- **Versatility:** Suitable for various languages and writing styles.
- **Pre-trained Models:** Choose from pre-trained models or train your own on custom datasets.
- **Easy Integration:** Simple API for seamless integration into your applications.

## Installation

```bash
pip install handwritten-text-recognizer
```

## Usage

```python
from handwritten_text_recognizer import HandwrittenTextRecognizer

# Initialize the recognizer
recognizer = HandwrittenTextRecognizer()

# Recognize text from an image
image_path = "path/to/your/image.jpg"
text = recognizer.recognize_text(image_path)

print("Recognized Text:", text)
```

## Pre-trained Models

We provide pre-trained models that you can use out of the box:

- **Model A:** Trained on a generic dataset, suitable for a wide range of applications.
- **Model B:** Specialized for cursive handwriting.

```python
# Load pre-trained model A
recognizer.load_model("model_A")

# Recognize text using the loaded model
text = recognizer.recognize_text(image_path)
```

## Training Your Own Model

To train a model on your custom dataset, follow these steps:

1. Prepare your dataset in the specified format.
2. Use the provided training script:

```bash
python train.py --dataset_path /path/to/dataset --model_name custom_model
```

3. Load your trained model:

```python
# Load custom-trained model
recognizer.load_model("custom_model")

# Recognize text using the custom-trained model
text = recognizer.recognize_text(image_path)
```
